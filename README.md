# Raspberry_Pi_Examples_For_Blue

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a website that was intended to help educators teach beginers java using blueJ, an IDE developed by kent university to help people learn java, on a raspberry Pi

The primary focus of this project is to teach and reinforce basic programming concepts of Java. To do this, we took advantage of Raspbian’s built in support for BlueJ and developed a wide variety of simple, but useful examples and tasks that interact with the Raspberry Pi and various physical components. These examples and tasks are at different levels of complexity, and the use of clear and concise tutorials will allow users to build upon their knowledge in a structured form.

## Java Examples, Exercises and Tutorials

We produced as many projects from the “planned projects” document as possible. The purpose of these programs was to demonstrate key Java programming concepts specifically on the Raspberry Pi, i.e. using the Pi4J library appropriately.

The concepts we touched upon include but are not limited to: Variables; calling Functions; using Objects within other Classes; simple and complex data structures; generic constructs such as For and While loops; Algorithms. As our intended target audience is beginner programmers (or end of first term Computer Science students), we did not set out to teach these concepts from scratch, rather reinforce them with interesting projects.

We felt that the examples didn’t quite provide enough educational value to our project. The format was changed to include the complete example class, PDF tutorial, and when applicable, incomplete and completed exercise classes.

The example classes contain fully working examples that utilize various components wired up to the Pi. These are our projects that we were previously working on before we modified our format slightly to include the extra material.

The incomplete exercises classes are intended for the user to complete in order to develop a solid understanding of the concepts we tried to convey in each particular example. All of these classes already compile without any syntax errors. This is so when the user opens the example they won’t be hit with tons of compilation errors that could lead to confusion. It also gives the user a solid base to work from instead of having to produce the class from scratch.

The completed exercises were added to give the students the ability to compare their attempts at the exercises with a correct, working copy. However, they may not have implemented it in the exact same way, so these completed exercise are only one possible interpretation.

We produced tutorials for each project. The purpose of these documents was to provide all the information required in order to assemble the project hardware as well as work through the exercises. Each document contains a summary of the project, parts required, an assembly diagram and assembly instructions. Also included is a list of exercises discussed above. We also added notes that contained useful tips or helpful information about the project.
	
The tutorials allowed us to provide a structured form of learning that can be used either individually or in groups. We believe that this could make our project a useful education resource and makes it more applicable in a formal academic environment.

We felt that asking the user to perform simple tasks in order to extend onto a program that already exists is a more interactive and engaging approach, compared to passive learning by just reading the code and being expected to understand the material. For example, the Motor project’s exercise class contains incomplete methods that would complete the intended functionality of the example class. The ‘forwardsFullSpeed()’ method compiles and contains relevant and helpful comments, but required the user to complete.
