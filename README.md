# Raspberry_Pi_Examples_For_Blue

This repository contains the code for a website that was intended to help educators teach beginers java using blueJ, an IDE developed by kent university to help people learn java, on a raspberry Pi

The primary focus of this project is to teach and reinforce basic programming concepts of Java. To do this, we took advantage of Raspbianâ€™s built in support for BlueJ and developed a wide variety of simple, but useful examples and tasks that interact with the Raspberry Pi and various physical components. These examples and tasks are at different levels of complexity, and the use of clear and concise tutorials will allow users to build upon their knowledge in a structured form.
